# Getting Started with the .NET MAUI BadgeView Control
The [.NET MAUI Badge View](https://www.syncfusion.com/maui-controls/maui-badge-view?utm_source=github&utm_medium=listing&utm_campaign=maui-badge-view-github-samples) is a notification control that is used to notify users of new or unread messages, notifications, or status information. A quick-start project that helps you integrate the Syncfusion Badge View control with a .NET MAUI application by adding the Syncfusion MAUI Core package from NuGet. This project contains simple code to apply predefined styles, icons, and other customizations.

### Adding the .NET MAUI BadgeView
**Step 1:** Add the NuGet to the project and add the namespace as shown in the following code sample:

**[XAML]**
```
xmlns:badge="clr-namespace:Syncfusion.Maui.Core;assembly=Syncfusion.Maui.Core"
```
**[C#]**
```
    using Syncfusion.Maui.Core;
```

**Step 2:** Set the BadgeView control to content in `ContentPage.`
```
<badge:SfBadgeView >        
</badge:SfBadgeView>
```
**[C#]**
``` 
SfBadgeView sfBadgeView = new SfBadgeView();
this.Content = sfBadgeView
```

**Step 3:** Adding a content

An Image, button, or label or any view can be added to the Badge View using the Content property.

```
<badge:SfBadgeView HorizontalOptions="Center" VerticalOptions="Center" BadgeText="20">
        <badge:SfBadgeView.Content>
            <Button Text="Primary" WidthRequest="120"  HeightRequest="60"/>
        </badge:SfBadgeView.Content>
</badge:SfBadgeView>
```
